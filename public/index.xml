      <description>Creative, organized, and self-motivated undergraduate student at Clarkson University. I am highly skilled with creative technical applications such as Premiere Pro, Adobe XD, and Sketch. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Iâ€™m a strong writer and public speaker with vital intrapersonal communication skills. I am a highly passionate filmmaker and video producer with a refined understanding of what makes good content. My greatest asset is my use of aesthetics and how I apply that to the content I create whether that be UX design, video production, web design, audio production etc.</description>
