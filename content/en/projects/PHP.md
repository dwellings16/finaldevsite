descritption: A simple store I coded with PHP.
title: "PHP store"
draft: true
---

I created a simple store that relies on PHP to carry out functions. the user can read about, create, update, and delete different products. I used phpMyadmin to set up the database for the store on my domain. I connected that database to my text editor (atom) by creating a database.php file. From there, I created an index.php file and a PHP file for creating, reading, deleting, and updating products.
