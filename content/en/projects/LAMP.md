 This is a LAMP server started from scratch. It has been secured phpMyAdmin and configured within the MAC os command line. I purchased a domain and set it up within my LAMP server. A basic digital ocean droplet was used to set up the server from the command line. There, I installed Apache, Mysql, and phpMyAdmin. Filezilla was used for SSH and SFTP connections which enabled the HTTPS of my domain. Once the LAMP server was up and my domain was setup, I installed Wordpress using phpMyAdmin.
