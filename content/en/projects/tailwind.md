descritption: A starter page made with Tailwind.js
title: "Tailwind Page"
draft: true
---


 This is a basic responsive page that consists of a nav bar, an image, some text, and an explore button. It is made with vanilla JS and a mix of custom and tailwind css. A node package manager(NPM) was set up to help run tailwind css in the atom text editor. The user can interact with the nav bar menu, which when shrunk to mobile size transforms into a hamburger menu symbol. The user can then click on the symbol and the menu options display. Unfortunately, I ran into some javascript issues and was unable to successfully get a drop down menu to appear properly.
