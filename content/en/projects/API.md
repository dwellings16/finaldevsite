descritption: A basic Fetch API made with HTML,CSS, and JS
title: "Fetch API"
draft: true
---

This is a basic fetch API that displays a very playful design of a retro gaming device that lists different pokemon as well as their attributes. The app was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The API that this app is fetching from is the PokeAPI. Each page is limited to 20 pokemon but there are multiple pages that the user can navigate between with the "Next" and "Prev" buttons.
