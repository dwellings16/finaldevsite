descritption: A simple store I coded with Svelte.js.
title: "Svelte store"
draft: true
---

This is a basic store that functions to allow users to create products, set a price, add a description and add them to their cart. This store was built using Node.js, svelte.js, and the atom text editor. Svelte.js is run and developed via a local server and would update automatically through the command line as long as the server was running through the node package manager. This project suffered a a massive bug that has still not been found, so the app is basically unusable.
