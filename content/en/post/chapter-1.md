Passwords are the medieval knight guards of our time. Protecting us from foreign internet attacks and data manipulation. Your machine is like your royal domain and is just as likely to get hijacked as any other domain. You wouldn't rely on one guard to protect everything in your domain because once he is struck, the rest of your domain is under attack and can be easily accessed. Keep in mind your domain has all your personal information and importantly your bank information (I know that banks didn't exist in the medieval times, please bare with me). For the same reason, you wouldn't rely on using the same password for all of your accounts because once that password is discovered every one of your accounts becomes very vulnerable.

If you're like me a couple years ago, you probably do this. If you do, you should probably go change some of your passwords. Before you do that, here are a couple tips when creating passwords.


## Stay Organized

It is super important to stay organized. A lot of people think to write their passwords down on sticky notes or notebooks which can be very risky. However, as long as the passwords you write down are stored in safe places and taken care of this, you should be set. You could also put your passwords in a text file on your phone or your computer and you'd want to make sure the text files are obviously labeled. You want to be discreet and oddly specific. Get weird with it. You also don't want to make sure you make too many passwords for different accounts so you're going to have to do some triage.

## Triage

Triage is the determination of urgency by the degree of vulnerability. In this context, it involves making different passwords for accounts that are super high risk if hacked and keeping the same password for accounts that wouldn't matter so much if they got hacked. For example, it would be ideal if your bank account and email password were different from your instagram or tik-tok account. It would decrease the number of passwords to remember if you used the same password for the accounts you're least worried about getting hacked. In other words, you want to be allocating your password security.


Stay safe out there and happy developing.
