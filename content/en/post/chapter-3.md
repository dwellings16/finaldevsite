The difference between websites and web apps are crucial to our understanding of fullstack developing. However, distinguishing between the two might not be as straight forward as you think. Luckily, there are few concrete differences to help you on your way as a developer.

## conceptual differences
One of the main differences between the two is what they are conceptually. In other words; what purpose do they serve? The main purpose of a website is to convey information to the user. The user can search things and click links and URL's to send them in the direction they would need to resolve the answers to their questions. Meanwhile, a web application's main purpose is the interaction between the user and the app itself. Navigating an app would is a more active process than a navigating a website. If we compare websites and applications to other media, a website would compare more to a build-your-own-adventure novel while an applications compares more to an open world RPG video game. Let's take the Clarkson University Website and the Clarkson Moodle application, for example. Moodle is a dominantly interactive experience. Students can upload their schoolwork via dropbox, message students and professors, and participate in typed forums. You create an account to let students and professors know who you are. It is *you* interacting within the app and know where else. Meanwhile, if you wanted to reach out to a professor on the Clarkson website, you would need to read, type into the search bar, and click their hyperlinked email address that sends you to your default email text box. That's about as interactive as it gets. Rather, the website allows users to learn what different majors and programs are offered, what campus life is like, where to book a visit, where the hell Potsdam, New York is, etc.

## Interactivity vs. Passivity

The one thing that will allow you to gain a better understanding of the difference between apps and websites is knowing interactivity vs. passivity. Those are pretty easy to understand. There are some really well known web apps that many of us use everyday. Most if not all social media is a web application, because they are insanely interactive to a point of addiction in many of their users. It's less likely that you'll bump into someone addicted to a website, unless we're talking about Porn sites, which could be debated heavily on whether they are considered applications vs. websites. However, I'm not going to get into that, but it's definitely some food for thought to leave you with.
