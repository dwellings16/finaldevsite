 User experience (UX) design may be a bit confusing to someone who has never heard of it before. That's because there are many different definitions floating around due to its various applications. To simplify, UX design works to create user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing products, websites, etc. For Web-developers, it is a crucial process of building an impressionable website that the user will want to come back to. It's easy for web-developers to get so caught up in the backend, trying to get their javascript to run, that the usability or user-friendliness gets neglected. But the truth is... an aesthetically pleasing design can outweigh the functionality of a website.

### The Aesthetic-Usability Effect


There is a whole array of laws and principles dedicated to UX design called the Laws of UX. One of the most prominent and important to understand is called [the Aesthetic-Usability Effect](https://lawsofux.com/aesthetic-usability-effect). The law basically states that visually pleasing design can mask minor usability errors and create an overall positive experience for many users of that website or product. In this case, pristine design is actually more important than a perfected usability. Realistically, the perfect website will never exist. A combination of perfect usability and design is a developer's ungraspable pipe dream.

However, This doesn't mean that you should neglect major back-end functionalities and center all of your focus on the front-end. It should help you gain a better understanding of the importance of design, because there are a lot of developers out there who produce stellar back-end code and put little thought into the front-end, not always realizing that the front-end is what the user is concerned with.

### Key Takeway: Balance

The front-end requires a much different mindset than the back-end. So, and this is especially important for full-stack developers, a balance must be found between simple usability and satisfying aesthetics.

To understand whether you and your team has achieved a good balance between the two, the website should be carried out through a series of tests with a wide range of participants, it will be most useful if these participants are human beings.

I hope that this leaves you with a better understanding of the importance of the visual design on your next project. It may mean squeezing a professional designer in your project's tight budget, but the value that it brings is exponential.
