To truly understand whether your team's product is working, it must be tested by people. More specifically, people who aren't as tech-savvy as the developing team. The less technologically skilled, the better. It's ideal to gather a large quantity of people from a diverse range of backgrounds and have them test the app, site, product etc. Once given the user a task to complete, then feedback from each user is analyzed. Although written and verbal feedback is helpful, it has the potential to be unreliable or dishonest.

One of the most important things to pay close attention to when testing is the body language of the user. Watch facial expressions, micro-aggressions, crying, smashing the keyboard across their knees or something of the nature. In all seriousness, the behavior of the user is very valuable when testing your team's product.

I now preach the importance of Behavior-Driven Development because I made a few mistakes when carrying out testing for a mobile app I created for a local movie theater. I used a basic google survey that I had the users fill out once they completed their instructed task. I made the mistake of leaving the room to give them space and relieve pressure when testing. This would have been a smart move if I was able to monitor body language from a distance, but I didn't and it wasn't until I sat down to right my report that those observations would have been helpful. It's important to mention that I only tested four other people and it was for a UX class, so most of the testers were pretty tech savvy. 75% of my feedback on the google surveys was way too positive and lacked any critique or additional comments. I did have one student give me great constructive feedback which I relied on for my report.

The example I gave might not have been very convincing as the sample was so small and similar. However, I took away a lot from this experience and think that it is worth sharing to those interested in UX testing and what goes into it.
